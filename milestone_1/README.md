Milestone 1
===========

README
------

For this milestone, I trained a logistic regression model on the training data Dota game data using some built in functions in the sklearn library. Statistics and an evaluation of the model using cross validation and mean squared error are produced into the "linearClassResults.txt" file by running "python linearClassModel.py".
